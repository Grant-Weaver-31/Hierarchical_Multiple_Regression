# Hierarchical Multiple Regression
On this project I served as a statistical consultant to Alexander Jochim on his masters' thesis for doing hieracchical multiple regression in R. I helped with the coding and the statistical intrepretation of the results. In the pdf you can note that I am listed on the acknowledgement section.
